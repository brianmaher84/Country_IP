# Country IP Chrome Plugin
This is a chrome plugin to display the flag of your current IP Address.  It may work in other Chrome based browsers as I have followed the Chrome API's.

# Why would you want to use this plugin?
This plugin is useful to ensure that your VPN is in the country you think it is which might can be important/useful for a number of reasons.  

e.g. It can be useful if your VPN connection drops as most likely the country will be different and so the icon will change.
